        <p>Delicious: Lasagna is a classic for a reason. Layered with meat sauce, noodles, and three kinds of cheese, what's not to like? It's so good!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground Beef:</strong> 93% lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> Dice half of a medium onion.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Mince three cloves.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong>You'll need a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> To season the tomatoes</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Buy oven-ready lasagna noodles, such as Barilla's, to make this easy lasagna with less steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> Eggs help bind the cheese mixture in lasagna so it doesn't run out when baked.</li>
        <li><strong>Ricotta Cheese:</strong> Use a good quality part-skim cottage cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Mozzarella:</strong> Mix some part-skim shredded mozzarella in the lasagna filling and sprinkle the remainder on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Grated Cheese</strong>You'll need a quarter cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese or Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Parsley</strong>Add chopped fresh parsley into the cheese mixture and garnish with more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the Tomato Sauce:</strong>Add the ground beef, onion, and garlic to a large skillet or large pot and cook on medium-high until the meat is no longer pink. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes, stir a few times.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Cheese Mixture:</strong>Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl and add the cottage cheese, a half cup of mozzarella, Pecorino Romano, and parsley.</li>
            <li><strong>How to Layer Lasagna:</strong> Spread a cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 13-x-9- inch casserole dish, followed by four lasagna noodles, a third of the cheese mixture, and a cup of sauce, and repeat. Next, pour the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with the rest of the mozzarella.</li>
            <li><strong>How to Bake Lasagna:</strong> Cooking time is about 1 hour. Cover the baking dish tight with aluminum foil to create steam to cook the noodles, and bake for 55 to 60 minutes until the pasta is cooked through. Uncover and cook for another five minutes until all the cheese browns slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish the lasagna with parsley and let sit for five minutes before cutting into eight pieces.</li>
