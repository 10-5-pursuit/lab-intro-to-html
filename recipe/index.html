        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First spread peanut butter on 1 slice. Make sure you put on enough, like half-inch, up to the crust.
            </li>
            <li>Wipe butter knife on the other piece of bread. Now it could be used to dip into the jelly.</li>
            <li>Now scoop out similar amount of jelly on the other piece. Do not spread smoothing jelly out to being
                even and thin. It's preferred to spread with globs.</li>
            <li>Take the bread piece with peanut butter and place it on top of the jelly piece.</li>
            <li>Tap sandwich gently for binding. Once complete, cut with butter knife in half. Enjoy!</li>
