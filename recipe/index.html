  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>500 g. hake fillet</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 ½ cup wheat flour</li>

    <li>1 lime</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clean the fish very well and rinse it under running water. Then put it on a cutting board, make sure it doesn’t have any spines. And with a sharp knife cut it into cubes of about two centimeters.</li>
    <li>Place the fish cubes in a bowl, season with grated ginger, lime juice, salt and pepper to taste. Be sure to rub the dressing into the cubes of fish until they are well coated.</li>
    <li>Crack the eggs in a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Stir well.</li>
    <li>Place the wheat flour on a flat plate, sprinkle a little salt on top. Put all the fish cubes on the plate and roll them in flour until they are completely coated.</li>
    <li>Take the cubes in batches, and transfer them to the bowl with the beaten eggs.</li>
    <li>Remove the fish from the bowl, and roll them around the plate of flour again until they are completely covered.</li>
    <li>Pour the oil into a pan, and turn the stove to medium high heat. When it starts to bubble, add the pieces of fish, preferably in batches so that they have enough space between them. Fry for about three to five minutes until golden brown. Remove from the pan, and leave the fried fish pieces resting on a plate lined with absorbent paper. Repeat this procedure with all the remaining pieces. Serve with fried yuquitas, salsa criolla and / or salsa verde and lime wedges.</li>
  </ol>
