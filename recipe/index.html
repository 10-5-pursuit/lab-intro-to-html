    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite. Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose | plain flour, (290 g | 10 oz)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener, (60g | 2 oz)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups milk, (440ml)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, (60g | 2 oz)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
        <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).(The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).
        </li>
        <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. </li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
        <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
    </ol>
